## How to use:

Create a virtual environment as follows:

```bash
python3 -m venv env

```
and activate it:

```bash
source env/bin/activate

```
Don't forget to update pip:


```bash
pip install --upgrade pip

```

Install the setup file as follows (the -e options allows to change the code while using it):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
